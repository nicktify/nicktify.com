<p>My academic background initially led me to pursue law studies at university in 2019. However, I discovered my true calling lay in software development. Transitioning into this field in late 2020, I embarked on a self-taught journey, harnessing a variety of online learning platforms such as Coursera, edX, Harvard&rsquo;s CS50 MOOC, and Udemy courses. One pivotal resource that significantly shaped my foundational knowledge was the book &lsquo;Computer Science: An Interdisciplinary Approach&rsquo; by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne. This resource offered me a comprehensive understanding of core computer science principles, propelling my growth as a developer.</p>
