### What Is AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model)?

AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) is an open-source framework for building serverless applications. It provides a simplified way of defining the Amazon API Gateway APIs, AWS Lambda functions, and Amazon DynamoDB tables needed by your serverless application. AWS SAM is based on AWS CloudFormation and extends it by adding a set of high-level constructs for serverless applications.
